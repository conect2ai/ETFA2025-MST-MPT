## 1. Abstract/Overview

The Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the widespread generation of multivariate time series that require real-time anomaly detection to ensure the reliability of monitoring and control processes. However, traditional methods based on offline training and batch processing are unsuitable for embedded devices, which operate under memory, computational, and energy constraints. To address these challenges, this work proposes two lightweight incremental algorithms derived from the TEDARLS framework. Both algorithms operate without prior training, updating their internal statistics in real-time, and are optimized for TinyML platforms. A case study was conducted in two stages, the models were first evaluated offline in a Python environment to analyze detection accuracy, correction behavior, and computational efficiency; subsequently, the algorithms were embedded on a Freematics One+ device connected to vehicles via the On-Board Diagnostics II (OBD-II) interface. MSTEDARLS achieved approximately 99% precision and 100% recall with inference times around 500 microsseconds, maintaining the original data characteristics. MPTEDARLS, although more sensitive to multivariate patterns, induced greater distortions and required processing times exceeding 4,200 microsseconds. Overall, MSTEDARLS demonstrated better stability and is more suitable for real-time anomaly correction in resource-constrained IoT edge applications.

This repository contains the source code and experimental materials associated with the MSTEDARLS (Multivariate Sequential TEDA-RLS) and MPTEDARLS (Multivariate Parallel TEDA-RLS) algorithms, developed for online anomaly detection and correction in multivariate vehicular data streams.

Both algorithms are designed to operate in real time, making them suitable for edge computing scenarios involving vehicular telemetry, such as OBD-II data acquisition.

## Repository Structure üìÇ

- **`./Freematics/`** ‚Äî Source code from the Freematics project used for the embedded experiments (ESP32, OBD-II communication, etc.).
- **`./src/`** ‚Äî Source code developed for MSTEDARLS and MPTEDARLS.
  - **`./src/cpp/`** ‚Äî C++ implementations for embedded systems.

- **`./figures/`** ‚Äî Figures generated for analysis and publication.
- **`.git/`** ‚Äî Version control metadata (Git).

## Datasets üìà

All experimental datasets are provided in `.csv` format within the `data/` folder.  
Each file contains the following variables:

| Variable | Description |
|:--------:|:-----------|
