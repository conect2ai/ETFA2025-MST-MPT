## 1. Abstract/Overview

The Internet of Things (IoT) generates massive multivariate time series data that requires real-time anomaly detection and correction to ensure reliable monitoring and control. However, conventional methods relying on offline training and batch processing are impractical for embedded IoT devices due to their severe memory, processing, and energy constraints. To address this gap, we propose two lightweight incremental learning algorithms: Multivariate Sequential TEDA with RLS Correction (MST) and Multivariate Parallel TEDA with RLS (MPT), both derived from the TEDARLS framework, which enable on-device detection and correction of multivariate anomalies within the constraints of TinyML resources. Both algorithms operate without prior training, continuously updating internal statistics in real-time to identify outliers and apply immediate corrections. In experiments using real vehicular sensor data on a TinyML microcontroller, MST achieved approximately 99% precision and 100% recall with inference times around 500Œºs, while preserving the original data characteristics. MPT, although more sensitive to multivariate patterns, introduced greater signal distortions and required processing times exceeding 4,200Œºs. Overall, MST demonstrated superior stability and is more suitable for real-time anomaly correction in resource-constrained IoT environments. By enabling lightweight, accurate, and autonomous anomaly detection and correction directly at the edge, this approach addresses a critical gap in embedded analytics for IoT systems.

This repository contains the source code and experimental materials associated with the MST (Multivariate Sequential TEDA-RLS) and MPT (Multivariate Parallel TEDA-RLS) algorithms, developed for online anomaly detection and correction in multivariate vehicular data streams.

Both algorithms are designed to operate in real time, making them suitable for edge computing scenarios involving vehicular telemetry, such as OBD-II data acquisition.

## Repository Structure üìÇ

- **`./Freematics/`** ‚Äî Source code from the Freematics project used for the embedded experiments (ESP32, OBD-II communication, etc.).
- **`./src/`** ‚Äî Source code developed for MST and MPT.
  - **`./src/cpp/`** ‚Äî C++ implementations for embedded systems.

- **`./figures/`** ‚Äî Figures generated for analysis and publication.
- **`.git/`** ‚Äî Version control metadata (Git).

## Datasets üìà

All experimental datasets are provided in `.csv` format within the `data/` folder.  
Each file contains the following variables:

| Variable | Description |
|:--------:|:-----------|
| `speed` | Vehicle speed (km/h) |
| `rpm` | Engine revolutions per minute (rpm) |
| `tp` | Throttle position (%) |
| `load` | Engine load (%) |
| `timing` | Ignition timing advance (¬∞) |

The datasets are organized as follows:
- **Original data** ‚Äî Vehicular signals without injected anomalies.
- **Corrected data** ‚Äî Data after processing with MST or MPT.
